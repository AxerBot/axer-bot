# Privacy Policy

Last modified July 11, 2022

## 1. Why and how do you collect my data?

AxerBot (the "Service") mainly provides an automated application for chat and social platforms, mainly for Discord, and is operated by the AxerBot Team (the "Team", "we", "us") for users of the Service (“you”). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that is collected from users of the Service. Under applicable law, the AxerBot Team is the "data controller" of personal data collected throughout your usage of the Service.

## 2. What information do you collect?

When you interact with us through the Service, we may collect information from you, as further described below.

We collect information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to our Services. Information we collect may include but are not limited to:

**Chat data**: We store username and user id to aid you and others with using our Service.
**osu! data**: We store your osu! id to access your public osu! information in order to provide you with functionality such as your profile info and statistics.
**Message logs**: If a server administrator enables the message logging feature, AxerBot will copy all deleted and edited messages in a text channel on that server which you might not have access to.
You can contact us at rayenattia@gmail.com to find out which channel this data is stored in. This data is not stored persistently on any of our servers.

AxerBot mainly gathers public data (but not save them) from the following sources:

- osu! API
- Discord API

## 3. Where is my data processed?

The Team is based in Tunisia. No matter where you are located, you consent to the processing and transferring of your information in and to Tunisia and other countries. The laws of Tunisia and other countries governing data collection and use may not be as comprehensive or protective as the laws of the country where you live.

Our servers are located in the United States of America.

## 4. What do you do with my data?

We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide information in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.

We use your data to:

(i) Monitor your compliance with our Terms of Service.
(ii) Allow you to persist and store data and settings.
(iii) Provide you with technology to enhance your experience with multiple services from osu! (Improving embeds for example.).
(iv) Provide you with technology that increases the quality-of-life experience in communities.
(v) Provide community administrators with technology to enhance the moderation experience.
(vi) Comply with legal requirements.

We do not sell your data ever.

## 5. How long do you store data?

We try to keep the duration that we store your data as low as possible. At most we store:

(i) Your login credentials to our Service until you terminate your account.
(ii) Your user data gathered from inside a chat or social platform for no longer than 30 days, as this is only cached and never saved to disk, this is usually considerably shorter.
(iii) Your messages gathered from inside a chat or social platform for no longer than 30 days, as this is only cached and never saved to disk, this is usually considerably shorter.

This excludes message logs as they're not stored on our servers, ever.

## Final

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Service after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach us via email at rayenattia@gmail.com, or via [Discord](https://discord.gg/MAsnz96qGy).
